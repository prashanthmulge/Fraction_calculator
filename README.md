# Fraction_calculator
Implementing a Fraction class that supports the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equality/non-equality, greater than/less than, and display.

For addition and substraction we take a LCM of denominator and then recalculate the new fraction and add them or subtract. And for multiplication we just multiply two numerator and denominator. But after this we need to simply it by dividing with GCD value of denominator and numerator.
Similarly we do calculate for equality and greater than between two fraction.
